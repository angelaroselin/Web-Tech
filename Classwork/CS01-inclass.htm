<a href="Babson.com">Babson</a> <p> I came to Babson on a CWEL Scholarship so that I can pursue an education that ranks among the top in entrepreneurship in the world. I am interested in traveling and social entrepreneurship. I believe that this would be an excellent opprotunity to build my Photography portfolio through the duration of this class.  </p>
