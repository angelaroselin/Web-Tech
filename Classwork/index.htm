<h1>Angela Lin</h1>
 <p> I came to <a href="http://www.Babson.edu">Babson</a> on a CWEL Scholarship so that I can pursue an education that ranks among the top in entrepreneurship in the world. I am interested in traveling and social entrepreneurship. I believe that this would be an excellent opprotunity to build my Photography portfolio through the duration of this class.  </p>
